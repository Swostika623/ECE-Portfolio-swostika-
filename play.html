          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I came to see how children learnt through play. It wasn’t just about fun, it was where so much growth happened. Educators didn’t treat play as something separate from learning; instead, it was the heart of the day, shaped around children’s interests and their developmental needs.

          One morning, I joined a group of children who were building a zoo with blocks and animal figurines. They worked together, planned where each animal would go, and even built enclosures with fences. I saw how this game supported their cognitive skills like problem-solving and memory, but also their social skills; there was communication between them, turn-taking, and compromise happening in that small space (Irving et al., 2018).

          In the outdoor area, I often saw play that supported physical development. One child spent a lot of time climbing up and down the fort, while another practised balancing on the stepping logs. Educators gently encouraged these gross motor skills by setting up obstacle courses or offering challenges like, “Can you hop to the next mat?” Inside, fine motor skills were supported through threading, puzzles, and art materials like scissors and glue sticks. I helped a child cut paper to make a crown one day, and while it looked like simple fun, they were actually building hand strength and coordination (AGDE, 2022).

          Imaginative play was also a big part of the day. The home corner was always buzzing with children role-playing as doctors, parents, or even chefs. I remember one group "cooked dinner" and invited me to try their pretend soup. These roleplay moments were more than cute; they helped the children express feelings, practice language, and explore real-world ideas through their own lens. Educators joined in at times, asking questions to extend the play and gently introducing new vocabulary, which helped with communication and thinking skills (ACECQA, 2020).

          This placement taught me that play isn’t just a way to fill time, it is the most natural and powerful way for children to learn. Through play, children explore the world, build relationships, solve problems, and express themselves in ways that matter to them. And as educators, when we tune into their play, we get to support their development in meaningful and respectful ways.
