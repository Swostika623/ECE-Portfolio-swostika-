          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I observed how the centre takes its responsibilities seriously when it comes to meeting legal and professional expectations. The educators made sure that everything they did, whether it was caring for the children, setting up learning spaces, or communicating with families, was done with a clear focus on safety, respect, and quality.
        </p>

        <p>
          Educators at the center follow the NQS by creating engaging and meaningful learning experiences. For example, when children showed an interest in insects, educators set up an exploration table with magnifying glasses and books to extend their curiosity. They also build strong relationships with children by providing one-on-one interactions, using positive reinforcement, and respecting children's voices in decision-making. These practices align with NQS Quality Areas 1 and 5, ensuring that children receive a well-rounded learning experience (Australian children’s Education and Care Quality Authority [ACECQA], 2020).
        </p>

          The EYLF principles were evident in how educators incorporated play-based learning and cultural inclusivity. I observed children being encouraged to explore materials freely, such as using sticks and stones to create structures during outdoor play. Educators also supported children’s sense of belonging by including their home cultures in discussions and activities. This approach fosters identity, confidence, and communication skills in children, as emphasized in the EYLF (AGDE, 2022). 
        </p>

          Another area that reflected strong regulatory understanding was how educators respected children’s rights and included them in decision-making. During group time, children were invited to share ideas for upcoming activities or talk about what they wanted to learn. I saw educators take these ideas seriously and plan accordingly. This approach helped create a respectful environment where children felt heard and valued, while still ensuring that learning experiences were age-appropriate and meaningful(ACECQA, 2020). 
        </p>

          Observing these national regulatory considerations has helped me understand their importance in shaping positive early childhood environments. The commitment of educators at Entrada Montessori Academy to these standards ensures children's safety, well-being, and learning. Reflecting on these practices has highlighted the significance of ongoing professional development to regulatory requirements in early childhood education.
