          Throughout my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I learned how important it is to support every part of a child’s development, not just their academic skills, but their emotional, social, physical, and creative growth too. The educators didn’t just focus on what children could do, but also how they felt, how they related to others, and how confident they were to explore new things (Garvis et al., 2019).

          One morning, I watched a small group of children working together on a large floor puzzle. At first, they needed help, but with gentle guidance and encouragement from the educator, they kept trying and helping each other. Even though it was just a puzzle, they were developing patience, teamwork, problem-solving, and persistence. I could see how activities like this helped build strong learning dispositions like curiosity, resilience, and confidence (Garvis et al., 2019).

          Emotional development was also a strong focus where educators were always focused into how children were feeling (AGDE, 2022). I remember one child who was a bit unsettled after drop-off, and the educator sat with him, offering comfort and giving him time to settle in at his own pace. She spoke softly, acknowledged his feelings, and helped him rejoin play when he was ready. That moment reminded me how much emotional support matters and how it helps children feel safe, understood, and ready to learn (AGDE, 2022).

          This experience helped me understand that learning is not just about reaching milestones, it’s about growing as a person. When we support children in all areas of their development, we help them become confident, kind, and capable learners. It’s our role as educators to notice their strengths, respond to their needs, and nurture their love of learning in every way.
