          The creation of respectful relationship plays a vital role in early childhood education because it helps all the educators to communicate effectively and understand their needs and plan in a better way for the development of the children in the service. At Entrada, I observed that every educator is focused to build a strong and trusting relationships with the children which helped to make the room calm, connected, and a safe and nurturing environment for all the children.

          I observed how the educators greeted each child by name, often getting down to their level and making eye contact. Some children ran in with big smiles, others needed a bit more time and reassurance and both were met with the same gentle tone and patience. It showed me how being responsive doesn’t always mean having all the answers, but being fully present and available when a child needs you (Porter, 2018).

          One day, a child in our room became upset when their usual educator was away for the day. Instead of distracting the child, another educator sat with the child quietly, acknowledged their feelings, and talked them through it gently, “You’re missing her today. That’s okay. She’ll be back tomorrow. I’m here with you today.” It was a small conversation, but the way it was handled calmly and respectfully helped the child felt validated and they could regulate their emotions and feel supported (Irving et al., 2018).

          During play, educators didn’t just supervise, they engaged. They joined in roleplay when invited, helped solve small problems when needed, and asked open-ended questions like, “What do you think will happen next?” or “Can you show me how you did that?” These moments helped deepen the children’s thinking and encouraged stronger communication skills with the educators (AGDE, 2022).

          This placement helped me understand that respectful relationships aren’t just built through big moments they’re built through everyday kindness, patience, and being truly responsive. Children easily understands when we listen, when we care, when we validate their feelings, and when we meet them where they are which helps to create a strong foundation for overall learning and wellbeing of the child.
