          At Entrada Montessori Academy, I saw how the team made a consistent effort to maintain high standards across everything they did, from daily routines to planning learning experiences. While the educators didn’t talk about the National Quality Standards by name, their everyday actions showed that these standards were being followed carefully to support children’s safety, learning, and well-being(ACECQA, 2020).

          As described in the NQS, child safety is a priority at the center. I saw how educators kept a close watch during outdoor play to prevent accidents, especially near equipment such as slides or swings. They were always nearby, ready to intervene if needed, while encouraging children to play independently. One day, I watched an educator assist children in practicing safety rules while riding tricycles. They reinforced the importance of using helmets and riding slowly, helping children understand the value of personal safety and responsibility (ACECQA, 2020). These practices show how the center ensures the well-being of every child while still fostering their independence.

          I also observed how educators worked together as a team by communicating clearly during transitions, supporting each other during busy times, and sharing responsibilities fairly. This helped everything run smoothly, and it created a calm and organised space for the children. I noticed that children were also more settled when the educators were confident and consistent in their roles. This strong teamwork created a positive and respectful workplace culture, which helped everyone, educators, and children to feel supported and secure. These quality practices were not treated like extra tasks, and every educator worked together by sharing their understanding of what is best for children, which helped to create a strong foundation for learning (ACECQA, 2020).

          This experience helped me to understand that maintaining high standards in early learning is not about ticking boxes, but it is about making thoughtful, respectful decisions every day that support children’s safety, development, and happiness.
