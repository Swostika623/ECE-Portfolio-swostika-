          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I learned how important it is to show respect and recognition for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and their cultures in early childhood settings. I saw how the educators made this a natural part of the children’s learning, not just through special events, but through everyday conversations, resources, and experiences (AGDE, 2022).

          One of the first things I noticed in the preschool room was the Acknowledgement of Country that the educators said with the children during morning group time where they used simple language that the children could understand, and often invited them to join in which helped the children in building the awareness of the land we are on and the Traditional Owners of it (Pascoe, 2018). I found that the regular use of Acknowledgement helped children develop a sense of respect and appreciation from a young age.

          There were also visual displays in the room that showed Aboriginal artwork, symbols, and stories. The educators explained to the children the meaning behind some of the patterns and symbols during story time and art activities. I remember one day when the children painted using earthy colours and dot painting techniques. While doing the activity, the educator shared a Dreaming story gently and engagingly. It was clear that the focus wasn’t just on the artwork, it was on understanding the cultural meaning behind it (Pascoe, 2018).

          Books in the reading corner included stories by Aboriginal authors, and when one educator read <em>"Welcome to Country"</em> by Aunty Joy Murphy, which sparked a lovely conversation about family, community, and belonging. The children were curious and asked lots of questions, and the educator answered them respectfully, encouraging the children to think deeply about the importance of culture.
        </p>

          The educators didn’t just talk about Aboriginal cultures from the past instead they made it clear that these cultures are alive and present today and they taught the children about ongoing connection to country, language, and traditions, which helped the children to understand about the culture of important members of our community (Pascoe, 2018). Even during outdoor play, children were encouraged to connect with nature respectfully. Educators would use words like “taking care of Country” and guide the children to be gentle with plants, bugs, and natural materials.
        </p>

          This experience helped me understand that showing respect for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and cultures is not just about teaching facts but it is about building genuine appreciation and embedding it into everyday practice in meaningful and respectful ways, it helps children to grow up with a stronger sense of empathy, understanding, and connection to Country.
