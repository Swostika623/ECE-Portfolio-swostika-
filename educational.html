          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I learned how important it is for the educational program and the learning environment to be designed around the children, not the other way around. Everything in the room, from the layout to the activities offered, was planned with the children's interests, strengths, and needs in mind.

          One of the first things I noticed was how thoughtfully the learning spaces were set up. Each area of the room invited different types of play and learning. There was a quiet reading corner with soft cushions for rest and reflection, a creative area with open-ended art materials, a block play space for construction and problem-solving, and a home corner for imaginative play. These environments allowed children to choose, explore, and learn at their own pace (Irving et al., 2018)..

          The educational program was built around what the children were curious about. I saw how the educators regularly observed children, took notes, and used that information to plan the next experiences. For example, when a few children started showing interest in gardening, the educators brought in real plants, watering cans. They extended this into stories about nature and even included science-based discussions on what plants need to grow (Irving et al., 2018).

          I also joined in group experiences like music circles, story times, and small group games. These were not only fun but helped support language development, social skills, and emotional regulation. Educators used these moments to model positive behaviour, ask open-ended questions, and encourage children to share their thoughts. Everything had a purpose; it was still playful and flexible, but carefully planned to support learning outcomes (Irving et al., 2018).
        </p>

          From this placement, I’ve learned that a strong educational program is not just about following a set plan; it’s about paying close attention to the children and building learning opportunities around what matters to them. And the learning environment is a big part of that, it needs to feel safe, welcoming, and inspiring so children can explore, take risks, and grow with confidence.
