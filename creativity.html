          Throughout my placement, I noticed that creativity was not just about the art area, but it was connected with every activity in which the children were included. This environment encouraged children to think independently, make their own choices, and explore their ideas in different ways, through drawing, movement, music, storytelling, and dramatic play (Isbell et al., 2020).

        <p>
          One of my favourite moments was watching a small group of children use loose parts like fabric scraps, cardboard rolls, and bottle caps to create a "rocket ship." No one told them what to do — they worked together, shared ideas, and added new features as they went. The educators supported them by asking open-ended questions like, “What will your rocket need to take off?” rather than giving instructions.

        <p>
          I also loved how creativity was brought into daily routines. For example, during morning group time, educators would sometimes use puppets to tell stories or act out social scenarios. The children were completely engaged and often joined in by giving the characters advice or retelling the story in their way. This made storytelling interactive and gave the children a chance to express themselves in new ways (Isbell et al., 2020).

        <p>
          In the art area, there were always open-ended materials like watercolours, collage items, and clay. Children weren’t expected to copy anything—instead, they were encouraged to make their own choices. One child spent nearly an hour mixing colours and painting abstract patterns. The educator praised the effort and curiosity rather than the outcome, which I think helped build the child’s confidence and love for creating (Howard, 2022).

        <i class="ph-light ph-music-notes text-blue-400 text-2xl mb-2 block"></i>
        <p>
          Music and movement were also used in creative ways where children made up their songs, danced freely during transitions, and explored rhythm with instruments. Creativity was seen as a part of everyday life, not just something that happened during "craft time." Some musical instruments were even kept in the outdoor play area for further exploration (Howard, 2022).

          Observing how creativity is supported in so many ways at the centre made me realise how important it is for children to have the freedom to explore and try new things. When they are provided with the space to be creative, they feel confident, keen, and excited to learn.
