        During my placement, I learnt the importance of observing and understanding each child before planning any activities for them. The educators made thoughtful observations every day for even the little moments — like how children react to food, how they cooperate with friends during play, and what interests them. This helped the educators plan activities tailored to each child’s growth and development.

        For example, I remember a time when a child was building with blocks and said, “I want to make a house with a door for my teddy.” The educator wrote this down as a learning observation, and the next day, she set up an invitation to build homes using different materials like cardboard boxes, fabric, and connectors. That simple observation led to a whole week of creative construction play. I learned how closely listening and paying attention to children can help plan meaningful learning (Arthur et al., 2020).

        Documentation at the centre was done in a very natural and meaningful way. I saw that educators didn’t just document big achievements, but also small everyday moments that showed how a child was learning and growing. For example, when a child was trying to put on their socks for the first time, the educator gently supported them and later wrote a short learning story about that moment (Arthur et al., 2020).

        Assessing children’s development wasn’t about testing them — it was about seeing how they were growing over time. Educators used observations to reflect on what each child could do, what they were working on, and what they might need next. This was a gentle and thoughtful approach. I was encouraged to do a few observations myself and use them to help plan small group experiences. I felt proud when my idea for a matching game based on a child’s interest was included in the daily activities (Arthur et al., 2020).

        In conclusion, taking the time to observe and document children’s learning helped me see just how much we can learn by simply watching and listening. These small moments show us who the child is, what they care about, and how we can support them in ways that truly matter. It’s a gentle but powerful part of teaching.
