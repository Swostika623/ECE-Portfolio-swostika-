          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I understood the importance of treating every child with kindness and fairness. The educators always made sure that all children felt safe, respected, and included, no matter their background, ability, or culture. I also learned that when we value each child for who they are, they feel more confident, validated and connected to their learning.

          The educators respected each child’s individuality. For example, when a child was having a hard day or needed space, the educators do not forced them to join the group. They would gently check in, offer support, and allow the child to rejoin when they felt ready. This showed me that dignity means giving children agency and treating their emotions with care (ACECQA, 2020).

          I saw educators constantly making sure each child had the same opportunities to participate, no matter their background or ability. One day during art time, a child with fine motor difficulties was offered alternative tools such as, bigger brushes and pre-cut materials, so they could still take part fully and feel successful. It wasn’t about doing everything the same, but giving each child what they needed to flourish (ACECQA, 2020).

          Cultural competence and diversity were also visible throughout the center. The classroom had books in different languages, dolls of varying skin tones, and posters that represented a range of cultures. I noticed that educators made an effort to include children’s home languages during songs or greetings. One child spoke both English and Hindi at home, and the educator encouraged them to teach a few Hindi words to the group. It made the child so proud, and it was a lovely way to honour their background (AGDE, 2022).

          Inclusion was also supported through routines. For instance, during group time, educators used visuals and hand gestures to help children who were still developing language skills or who spoke English as a second language. Every child was given a role by passing out name tags, choosing the storybook, or helping tidy up so, they felt like they belonged and included in the class (AGDE, 2022).

          Overall, these experiences taught me that creating a respectful and inclusive environment starts with how we see and treat each child as capable, unique individuals who bring their own stories and strengths. When we truly value diversity and respond with empathy and fairness, we help children feel safe, confident, and proud of who they are.
