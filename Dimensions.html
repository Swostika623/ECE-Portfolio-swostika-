    <h1>The Dimensions of Professionalism</h1>
    <p>Professionalism and ethical practices are essential to create a respectful, safe, and inclusive environment in early childhood education. During my placement in the preschool room at Entrada Montessori Academy, I observed how educators maintained professionalism in their interactions and followed ethical guidelines to support children’s well-being. Their approach ensured that all children, families, and staff felt valued and respected.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>One example of ethical practice I followed was maintaining confidentiality. I was not allowed to take pictures on my phone, so I used the center’s iPad to take photos of a child for whom I had consent and then uploaded them following the center's procedure. This ensured that the child’s privacy was respected while still documenting their learning. I also observed that educators always discussed children’s progress privately with families rather than in public areas, ensuring confidentiality was maintained. This was important because it built trust between educators and families, showing that the centre valued their privacy and followed ethical guidelines (AGDE, 2022).</p>
    </div>

    <p>In team meetings and daily briefings, the staff followed the centre’s policies closely. For example, when discussing transitions between rooms or managing children’s rest times, everyone referred back to the written guidelines. I could see how seriously they took their duty of care, making sure every child was supervised, accounted for, and supported. Educators would double-check allergy notes and communicate clearly when children moved between spaces. This attention to detail shows how professionalism is not just about big decisions, but also about everyday actions that keep children safe and cared for (Irving et al., 2018).</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <p>What worked well in this setting was how the team supported each other professionally. If any educators were unsure about a policy or how to handle a situation, they would ask another educator, and the response was always respectful and collaborative. This approach has helped build a strong professional culture where everyone feels supported, and children also learn to support and respect others by observing such professional actions from the educators (Irving et al., 2018).</p>
    </div>

    <p>In conclusion, working with the educators at Entrada Montessori Academy helped me to understand the importance and practical application of professionalism on a daily basis. The way all the educators respected each other, followed the rules, and supported children with care made the environment feel safe and welcoming. It was visible that everyone in the service was treated with kindness and respect, including all the educators, children, and their families.</p>
