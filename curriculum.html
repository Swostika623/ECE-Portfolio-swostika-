          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I noticed how the educators planned learning experiences that truly reflected what mattered to the children. From the way the room was set up to the experiences offered, to support each child’s sense of belonging, wellbeing, and growth. The curriculum wasn’t something separate, it was found in everyday aspects developed for the child's overall development (AGDE, 2022).

          I also noticed that educators always encouraged children to make choices. For example, during play, children were invited to choose where they wanted to go—puzzles, pretend play, construction, or art. There wasn’t one “right” activity. Educators moved around, asking open-ended questions, and helped extend learning based on where the children were and what they were doing. This supported children’s agency and made learning feel joyful and meaningful (ACARA, 2020).

          Routines were also used as part of learning. During morning group time, children were supported to share their ideas, stories from home, or how they were feeling. Some children were shy, so educators gently encouraged them with small prompts or let them pass if they didn’t want to talk. This helped children build confidence and communication skills at their own pace (Porter, 2016).

          Inclusivity was another big part of what I saw. One child in the room had a speech delay, and I noticed how educators used visual aids, key signs, and slower speech to support him. They celebrated his small wins and made sure he was included in every group activity. It reminded me that the curriculum isn’t just about what we teach, but how we make sure each child can access learning in their own way (ACECQA, 2020).

          Educators also linked learning to home life. They created a family tree and pasted that on the wall, and asked each child to bring their family photos and pasted those pictures on that tree, which helped each child to feel included and validated. During the programs conducted by the service on the occasion of Harmony Day, Holi program, and Easter program, families were also invited to join in the activity where there were different performances by children.

          Being part of Entrada Montessori Academy for my placement helped me see how the national curriculum isn’t about strict lessons, it’s about knowing children deeply, listening to them, and creating opportunities that help them grow socially, emotionally, and intellectually. It’s about helping them feel like they belong, while giving them space to explore and express themselves in their own way.
