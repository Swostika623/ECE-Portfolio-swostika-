          At Entrada Montessori Academy, I noticed that educators were very thoughtful and intentional in the way they cared for and taught the children. Each child’s learning was supported based on their individual needs, abilities, and interests. For example, I observed how educators planned learning experiences that matched the children’s current curiosity, whether it was dinosaurs, nature, or cooking. This helped keep children engaged and allowed them to feel confident and included in the learning process. I could see that children were viewed as capable and active learners (Australian Government Department of Education [AGDE], 2022).

          I also noticed that educators made sure to provide a range of learning experiences, including quiet activities, sensory play, group tasks, and independent exploration. This approach allowed children with different learning styles to develop and build their interest. It showed me that supporting children’s learning isn’t just about what we teach but how we create an environment where every child feels they belong and can succeed (Arthur et al., 2020).

          The educators took their responsibilities very seriously when it came to safety and supervision. I saw how they did headcounts during transitions, checked outdoor spaces before play, and made sure all staff were aware of children’s medical needs like allergies. These routines were part of their duty of care and were followed closely, without shortcuts. I also saw how they handled sensitive conversations with families respectfully and privately. One time, a parent had a concern about their child’s eating. The educator gently reassured the parent and arranged a follow-up discussion, making sure it wasn’t discussed in front of other families or staff.

          Another important observation was how educators responded to children’s emotions. If a child became upset or frustrated, educators didn’t raise their voice or rush them. Instead, they got down to the child’s level, spoke gently, and helped them calm down or find another activity. This respectful approach showed that educators truly cared about the children’s emotional well-being and wanted them to feel safe and understood (Arthur et al., 2020).
        </p>

          This experience helped me realise how important it is to follow ethical responsibilities and professional obligations in early childhood settings. It’s not just about doing things the “right” way, but about building trust with children and families, supporting each child’s growth, and creating a learning environment where everyone feels included and respected.
