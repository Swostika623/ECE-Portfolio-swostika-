          During my placement at Entrada Montessori Academy, I realised how powerful play can be when we truly join in with children and create playful, open-ended experiences. I used to think that play was just for fun, but now I understand that it’s one of the most important ways children learn, build relationships, and develop confidence (Feldman et al., 2021).

          I noticed that the educators didn’t just supervise play, they played alongside the children. Whether it was pretending to be chefs in the play kitchen, building train tracks on the floor, or creating imaginary animals in the sandpit, the educators were right there with the children, asking questions, sharing stories, and helping extend their thinking. It made the children feel seen and valued, and it turned simple play moments into rich learning opportunities (Feldman et al., 2021).

          One day, I was invited to join a group of children in a vet role-play setup. They had soft toys, bandages, and clipboards. I asked, “What’s wrong with this puppy?” and that led to a whole story about how he hurt his paw and needed surgery. The children worked together, shared ideas, and took turns being the vet. It was a fun game, but I could see them practising empathy, communication, and problem-solving all at the same time (Sheridan et al., 2017).

          Play was also used to support physical development. Outdoors, children were given opportunities to climb, balance, and run, which helped develop their gross motor skills. Indoors, I saw activities like threading beads, drawing with chalk, or using tweezers to move pom-poms, which supported their fine motor control. These playful activities were always based on children’s interests, and educators would often ask the children what they wanted to do or set up invitations to play based on recent conversations or observations  (AGDE, 2022). The children were provided with the freedom to explore, make choices, and lead their play which made the environment feel joyful, calm, and respectful of each child’s way of learning  (Feldman et al., 2021).

          Being part of the children’s play helped me build strong connections with them and I learned that when we follow their lead, listen to their ideas, and get involved in their world, they feel supported and confident. Play isn’t just fun—it’s how children make sense of things, build friendships, and learn about themselves and others.
