          During my placement in the preschool room at Entrada Montessori Academy, I started to understand that being a professional teacher isn’t just about knowing what to teach; it’s about how we show up for the children, families, and our team every single day. It’s about the little things we do that show we care, that we’re learning, and that we’re doing our best to support every child in their way.

          The educators remembered small details about each child like how one child liked to hold a soft toy during rest time, or how another preferred to use crayons instead of paint. They adjusted experiences based on what the children were comfortable with, rather than expecting every child to fit into one way of learning. Observing such kind of acts made me realise how important it is to observe and listen before we plan anything for the children (Arthur et al., 2020).

          I also saw how respectful and professional the educators were with families. Every morning and afternoon, they took the time to greet families warmly and share little updates. I remember one moment where a parent looked a bit worried about their child's rude and aggressive behaviour, and the educator gently reassured them with kind words. During the group time, the educator taught children about the importance of family and how we should behave with our parents. It was a small moment, but it showed me how much families rely on us and how much trust they place in our care (Porter, 2016).

          After group times or activities, my supervisor would often ask, “How do you think that went?” At first, I didn’t always know how to answer, but over time I started thinking more deeply about what worked, what didn’t, and what I could try next time. That reflection helped me feel like I was growing, not just doing tasks, but learning to be a thoughtful educator.
        </p>

        <p>
          Overall, what I’ve learned is that professionalism in teaching isn’t just about having the right answers; it is about being present, respectful, reflective, and always willing to learn. It’s the way we build relationships, support each other, and do our best to make every child feel safe and supported in their learning journey.
