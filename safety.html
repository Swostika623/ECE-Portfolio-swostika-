          During my placement in the preschool room at Entrada Montessori Academy, I observed how closely educators followed the rules and responsibilities that guide early childhood education in Australia. These regulations ensure that every child’s safety, health, and learning needs are met every day while they are at the centre (AGDE, 2022).

          The educators made sure children’s basic needs were always taken care of by carefully planning the meals and snack times based on each child’s dietary requirements. For example, I saw how educators double-checked allergy lists before serving food, and children with allergies had their meals clearly labelled and separated, with separate, colour-coded utensils. This showed a strong commitment to children’s health and safety, and it helped families feel reassured that their children were being cared for in a proper manner (AGDE, 2022).

          I also noticed how the team responded to the weather when planning outdoor activities. On very hot days, outdoor play was kept shorter, and the educators encouraged water play and made sure all children wore hats and sunscreen. On cooler days, they still encouraged physical activity outside but made sure children were dressed warmly and comfortably. This kind of planning shows how the team takes the children's well-being seriously, making sure they are safe and physically active in a way that suits the environment (AGDE, 2022).

          Health and hygiene were also taken seriously. Children were guided to wash their hands properly before meals and after outdoor play. Educators cleaned tables and floors regularly and followed hygiene procedures closely, especially during nappy changes, meal times, and toileting times, which helps to keep the children, environment, and the educators healthy and safe from any kind of illness (ACECQA, 2020). 
        </p>

          Overall, these practices helped me to understand the importance of following national requirements in early learning settings. This set of rules helps to make sure about the methods used to take care of children in the best possible. When all the educators take their responsibility carefully for safety, health, and well-being, children are able to grow, feel secure, and protected at the centre.
